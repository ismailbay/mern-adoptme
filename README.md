# Pet Adoption Website

This project is a part of a series of learning projects aimed at ~~mastering~~ understanding the popularity of
JavaScript, TypeScript, and various web frameworks.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a **fictional** platform where users can browse and ask to adopt pets from various
animal care institutes. Pets available for adoption are fetched from these institutes and displayed on the website.

In this part, I focus on building a fictional website for pet adoptions using the MERN stack with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

As far as I understand, MERN stack seems to be the starting point of rising popularity of fullstack JavaScript
development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `client`: Contains the frontend React application.
- `server`: Contains the backend Express.js application.

## Future Projects

This project is part one of a series of projects aimed at learning various web development technologies. The upcoming projects include:

- **Part 2:** Prisma Express React Node.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS  
  Focus: switching to Typescript
- **Part 3:** Next.js with TypeScript  
  Focus: Server Rendering
- **Part 4:** Backend Frameworks    
  Focus: REST services using one of Koa, Fastify or Deno
